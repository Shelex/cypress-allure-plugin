## Getting Started

-   Fork the repository on GitHub
-   Read the [README](README.md) for getting started as a user and learn how/where to ask for help
-   If you want to contribute as a developer, continue reading this document for further instructions
-   Play with the project, submit bugs, submit pull requests!

### Contribution workflow

#### 1. Set up your environment

1. You'll need the following tools:

-   [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
-   [Node.JS](https://nodejs.org/en/), x64, version >= 10.16.0, < 11.0.0
-   [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), version >= 1.38.0

2. Fork this repository and clone it by running:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:<yourusername>/cypress-allure-plugin.git
```

3. Install dependencies:

```bash
cd cypress-allure-plugin
npm install
```

4. You can run tests to validate that setup is fine:

-   `npm run test:prepare:basic` - run tests from `cypress/e2e/basic` with allure results copied into `cypress/e2e/fixtures/basic`
-   `npm run test:prepare:cucumber` - run tests from `cypress/e2e/cucumber` with allure results copied into `cypress/e2e/fixtures/cucumber`
-   `npm test` - run tests from `cypress/e2e/results` against these allure results in `cypress/e2e/fixtures`

#### 2. Find a feature to work on

-   Look at the existing [issues](https://github.com/90poe/cypress-allure-plugin/issues) to see if there is anything
    you would like to work on. If don't see anything then feel free to create your own feature request.

-   If you are a new contributor then take a look at the issues marked
    with [good first issue](https://github.com/90poe/cypress-allure-plugin/labels/good%20first%20issue).

-   Make your code changes within a feature branch:

    ```bash
    git checkout -b <feature-name>
    ```

*   Try to commit changes in logical units with a commit message in this [format](#commit-message-format). Remember
    to signoff your commits.

*   Don't forget to update the docs if relevent. The [README](README.md) is where docs usually live.

*   Make sure the tests pass and that there are no linting problems.

#### 3. Create a pull request

Push your changes to your fork and then create a pull request to origin. Where possible use the PR template.

You can mark a PR as wotk in progress by prefixing the title of your PR with `WIP:`.

### Commit Message Format

We would like to follow the **Conventional Commits** format for commit messsages. The full specification can be
read [here](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0-beta.3/). The format is:

```
<type>: <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer]
```

Where `<type>` is one of the following:

-   `feat` - a new feature
-   `fix` - a bug fix
-   `chore` - changes to the build pocess, code generation or anything that doesn't match elsewhere
-   `docs` - documentation only changes
-   `style` - changes that don't affect the meaning of the code (i.e. code formatting)
-   `refactor` - a change that doesn't fix a feature or bug
-   `test` - changes to tests only.

The `body` should include details of what changed and why. If there is a breaking change then the `body` should start with the
following: `BREAKING CHANGE`.

The footer should include any related github issue numbers.

An example:

```text
feat: Added new command to run cypress

A new command has been added to run cypress. The
command will execute cypress for single spec file with option `--no-exit`

Fixes: #123
```

A tool like [Commitizen](https://github.com/commitizen/cz-cli) can be used to help with formatting commit messages.
