## Installation

-   [Allure binary](https://docs.qameta.io/allure/#_get_started): [directly from allure2](https://github.com/allure-framework/allure2#download) or [allure-commandline npm package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/allure-commandline).

-   [Java 8](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jdk8-downloads.html) (required to run allure binary)

-   There is no need to set this plugin as reporter in Cypress or use any other allure reporters. Just download:

    -   using yarn:

    ```bash
    yarn add -D @shelex/cypress-allure-plugin
    ```

    -   using npm:

    ```
    npm i -D @shelex/cypress-allure-plugin
    ```

## Setup

-   (Before Cypress 10) Connect plugin in `cypress/plugins/index.js`. Take into account that Cypress generate plugins file with `module.exports` on the first initialization but you should have only one export section. In order to add Allure writer task just replace it or add writer task somewhere before returning config:

    ```js
    const allureWriter = require('@shelex/cypress-allure-plugin/writer');
    // import allureWriter from "@shelex/cypress-allure-plugin/writer";

    module.exports = (on, config) => {
        allureWriter(on, config);
        return config;
    };
    ```

-   (After Cypress 10) Use `defineConfig` and `setupNodeEvents` inside config.js\config.ts files:

    ```js
    const allureWriter = require('@shelex/cypress-allure-plugin/writer');
    // import allureWriter from "@shelex/cypress-allure-plugin/writer";

    module.exports = defineConfig({
        e2e: {
            setupNodeEvents(on, config) {
                allureWriter(on, config);
                return config;
            }
        }
    });
    ```

    -   if you have webpack or other preprocessors
        
        -   Please take into account that some plugins/preprocessors may register event listeners in Cypress (especially `after:spec` to have access to results) which will block work other plugins. To make allure-plugin work with such plugins/preprocessors please use env variable `allureReuseAfterSpec: true` 

        -   (Before Cypress 10) please set allure writer before returning "config":

        ```js
        const allureWriter = require('@shelex/cypress-allure-plugin/writer');
        // import allureWriter from "@shelex/cypress-allure-plugin/writer";

        module.exports = (on, config) => {
            on('file:preprocessor', webpackPreprocessor);
            allureWriter(on, config);
            return config;
        };
        ```

        -   (After Cypress 10) use `defineConfig` and `setupNodeEvents` inside config.js\config.ts files:

        ```js
        const allureWriter = require('@shelex/cypress-allure-plugin/writer');
        // import allureWriter from "@shelex/cypress-allure-plugin/writer";

        module.exports = defineConfig({
            e2e: {
                setupNodeEvents(on, config) {
                    on('file:preprocessor', webpackPreprocessor);
                    allureWriter(on, config);
                    return config;
                },
                env: {
                    allureReuseAfterSpec: true
                }
            }
        });
        ```

-   Register commands in `cypress/support/index.js` (or `cypress/support/e2e.js` for cypress 10+) file:

    -   with `import`:

    ```js
    import '@shelex/cypress-allure-plugin';
    ```

    -   with `require`:

    ```js
    require('@shelex/cypress-allure-plugin');
    ```

-   for IntelliSense (autocompletion) support in your IDE add `tsconfig.json` and specify `types` property for `compilerOptions`:

```json
 "compilerOptions": {
        "allowJs": true,
        "baseUrl": "./",
        "types": ["@shelex/cypress-allure-plugin"],
        "noEmit": true
    },
```

## Configuration

Plugin is customizable via Cypress environment variables:

| env variable name                      | description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | default                                                     |

These options could be passed in multiple ways, you can check [docs](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/guides/environment-variables#Setting).
But also you can use `allure.properties` file (but you still need to enable allure by passing `allure=true` to cypress env variables):

```bash
allure.results.directory=custom_dir
allure.link.issue.pattern=https://example.com/task_
allure.link.tms.pattern=https://example.com/test_case_
allure.cypress.log.commands=true
allure.cypress.log.requests=true
allure.cypress.log.gherkin=true
allure.omit.previous.attempt.screenshot=true
allure.analytics=false
allure.video.passed=false
```

## Execution

-   To enable Allure results writing just pass environment variable `allure=true`, example:

```bash
npx cypress run --env allure=true
```

-   if allure is enabled, you can check gathered data, in cypress window with Chrome Developer tools console:

```js
Cypress.Allure.reporter.runtime.writer;
```

## Troubleshooting
Answers to common questions/issues:
 - I open allure report and I see just empty results with NaN counters
 > You should not open allure report directly as a static html page. It uses local resources, thus is banned by modern browsers and requires web server to be opened properly. To resolve it you can disable CORS (not recommended), use live server extension for vs code, or just use `allure serve` command (recommended). To serve generated report an s3 bucket with hosting option could be used or any other web hosting.
 - My other plugins do not work / allure-results is not generated
 > It is likely other plugins (as cucumber-preprocessor) may also listen to events (especially after:spec) in Cypress that this plugin uses. Unfortunately, only one listener is available and other are just overwritten, that's why you can pass env variable `allureReuseAfterSpec: true`  to not create new listeners from this plugin, but reuse existing.

## Debugging

-   for in-browser information (cypress events, mocha events, allure events, data collecting)
    execute `localStorage.debug = 'allure-plugin*'` in DevTools console
-   for writer task information (writing results to disk, handling attachments, plugin events)
    add `DEBUG=allure-plugin*` before cypress run\open command

## Examples

See [cypress-allure-plugin-example](https://github.com/Shelex/cypress-allure-plugin-example) project, which is already configured to use this plugin, hosting report as github page and run by github action. It has configuration with complete history (allure can display 20 build results ) with links to older reports and links to CI builds.

There are also existing solutions that may help you prepare your report infrastructure:

-   [Allure docker service](https://github.com/fescobar/allure-docker-service) - highly customizable feature-rich container
-   [Allure Server](https://github.com/kochetkov-ma/allure-server) - self-hosted portal with your reports
-   [allure-reports-portal](https://github.com/pumano/allure-reports-portal) - another portal which allows to gather reports for multiple projects in single ui
-   [allure-static-booster](https://gitlab.com/seitar/allure-static-booster/-/tree/master/) - solution for generating self-hosted Allure report on GitLab pages including the tables with results, pipeline links and navigation between the different Allure reports.
-   [Github Action](https://github.com/simple-elf/allure-report-action) - report generation + better implementation for historic reports described above

## How to open report

Assuming allure is already installed:

-   serve report based on current "allure-results" folder: `allure serve`
-   generate new report based on current "allure-results" folder: `allure generate`
-   open generated report from "allure-report" folder: `allure open`

## API

There are three options of using allure api inside tests:

1. Using interface from `Cypress.Allure.reporter.getInterface()` - synchronous

```js
const allure = Cypress.Allure.reporter.getInterface();
allure.feature('This is our feature');
allure.epic('This is epic');
allure.issue('google', 'https://google.com');
```

2. Using Cypress custom commands, always starting from `cy.allure()` - chainer

```js
cy.allure()
    .feature('This is feature')
    .epic('This is epic')
    .issue('google', 'https://google.com')
    .parameter('name', 'value')
    .tag('this is nice tag', 'as well as this');
```

3. Using Cypress-cucumber-preprocessor with cucumber tags:

```feature
@testID("id_of_test_for_testops")
@parentSuite("someParentSuite")
@suite("someSuite")
@subSuite("someSubSuite")
@epic("thisisepic")
@feature("nice")
@story("cool")
@severity("critical")
@owner("IAMOwner")
@issue("jira","JIRA-1234")
@tms("tms","TC-1234")
@link("other","url")
@someOtherTagsWillBeAddedAlso
Scenario: Here is scenario
...
```

Allure API available:

-   testID(id: string)
-   epic(epic: string)
-   feature(feature: string)
-   story(story: string)
-   parentSuite(name: string)
-   suite(name: string)
-   subSuite(name:string)
-   label(name: LabelName, value: string)
-   parameter(name: string, value: string)
-   testParameter(name: string, value: string)
-   testName(name: string)
-   link(url: string, name?: string, type?: LinkType)
-   issue(name: string, url: string)
-   tms(name: string, url: string)
-   description(markdown: string)
-   descriptionHtml(html: string)
-   owner(owner: string)
-   severity(severity: Severity)
-   tag(tags: ...string)
-   attachment(name: string, content: Buffer | string, type: ContentType)
-   testAttachment(name: string, content: Buffer | string, type: ContentType)
-   fileAttachment(name: string, path: string, type: ContentType)
-   startStep(name: string)
-   endStep()
-   step(name: string, isParent: boolean)
-   logStep(name: string)
-   logCommandSteps(state: boolean)

## Gherkin and tms or issue links

It is posible to pass tms link or issue link with tags `tms("ABC-111")` and `issue("ABC-222")`.
However, that will not work well with Scenario Outlines which may have different examples being linked to different tasks or test cases in tms.
So, plugin will also parse your scenario outlines with examples and in case header in table will be `tms` or `issue` - it will add it as link to report.

```gherkin
    Scenario Outline: Some scenario
        Given User want to link test <number> to tms
        When User creates examples table with tms and issue headers
        Then Links will be added to allure
        Examples:
            | tms    | issue   | number |
            | TEST-1 | JIRA-11 | 1      |
            | TEST-2 | JIRA-22 | 2      |
```

## VS Code for cypress + cucumber

In case you are using VS Code and [Cypress Helper](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Shelex.vscode-cy-helper) extension, it has configuration for allure cucumber tags autocompletion available:

```js
"cypressHelper.cucumberTagsAutocomplete": {
        "enable": true,
        "allurePlugin": true,
        "tags": ["focus", "someOtherTag"]
    }
```

## Screenshots and Videos

Screenshots are attached automatically, for other type of content feel free to use `testAttachment` (for current test), `attachment` (for current executable), `fileAttachment` (for existing file).

Videos are attached for failed tests only from path specified in cypress config `videosFolder` and in case you have not passed `video=false` to Cypress configuration. In case you want to attach videos for passed tests please use `allureAddVideoOnPass=true` env variable.

It is done with the help of [After Spec API](https://docs.cypress.io/api/plugins/after-spec-api).
It will be used for:

-   run mode with v6.7.0 and above
-   run mode with v6.2.0 and above (but below v6.7.0) with `experimentalRunEvents` enabled
-   interactive (open) mode for v7.1.0 with `experimentalInteractiveRunEvents` enabled
    When one of this conditions is satisfied - `after:spec` event will be used for attachments. It will reliably copy all screenshots available for each test and video (if available) to your `allure-results` folder and attach to each of your tests, so you don't need to somehow upload your videos and configure paths, etc.

In lower versions some other heuristics would be used, but they are not as reliable as `after:spec`.

## Suite structuring

Allure support 3 levels of suite structure:

-   `Suite` tab: `parentSuite` -> `suite` -> `subSuite` -> tests
-   `Behaviors` tab: `epic` -> `feature` -> `story` -> tests

They are defined automatically by structure passed from cypress mocha test object with titles of each parent.
So an array of names of `describe` blocks is just transformed into:
`[parentSuite, suite, "subsuite1 -> subsuite2 -> ..."]`

However, since v2.29.0 you can modify the strategy of defining names for structuring the tests by overwriting the function in `support/index` file using `Cypress.Allure.reporter.getInterface().defineSuiteLabels` which will accept your function:

```js
// remove all describe block names and leave just last one:
Cypress.Allure.reporter
    .getInterface()
    .defineSuiteLabels((titlePath, fileInfo) => {
        return [titlePath.pop()];
    });
```

This function will have 2 arguments. `titlePath` is that array of describe names, and `fileInfo` is a parsed representation of a filepath for cases when you want to include folder or filename into some names, or just wrap suites in folders, or implement any of your ideas how to structure tests in reports.

```js
// supplement parentSuite name with folder name
Cypress.Allure.reporter
    .getInterface()
    .defineSuiteLabels((titlePath, fileInfo) => {
        const [parentSuite, suite, ...subSuites] = titlePath;
        return [`${fileInfo.folder} | ${parentSuite}`, suite, ...subSuites];
    });
```

```js
// make folder name a parentSuite:
Cypress.Allure.reporter
    .getInterface()
    .defineSuiteLabels((titlePath, fileInfo) => {
        return [fileInfo.folder, ...titlePath];
    });
```

```js
// remove any other describe blocks and just show last one:
Cypress.Allure.reporter
    .getInterface()
    .defineSuiteLabels((titlePath, fileInfo) => {
        return [titlePath.pop()];
    });
```

```js
// remove describe names and just place tests in folder -> filename structure:
Cypress.Allure.reporter
    .getInterface()
    .defineSuiteLabels((titlePath, fileInfo) => {
        return [fileInfo.folder, fileInfo.name];
    });
```

## Cypress commands as steps

Commands are producing allure steps automatically based on cypress events and are trying to represent how code and custom commands are executed with nested structure.  
Moreover, steps functionality could be expanded with:

-   `cy.allure().step('name')` - will create step "name" for current test. This step will be finished when next such step is created or test is finished.
-   `cy.allure().step('name', false)` OR `cy.allure().logStep('name')` - will create step "name" for current parent step/hook/test. Will be finished when next step is created or test finished.
-   `cy.allure().startStep('name')` - will create step "name" for current cypress command step / current step / current parent step / current hook or test. Is automatically finished on fail event or test end, but I would recommend to explicitly mention `cy.allure().endStep()` which will finish last created step.  

To disable tracking of specific cypress commands to be not logged as steps in allure you can set env variable `allureAvoidLoggingCommands` which should contain an array of command names to be ignored, for example:
```json
allureAvoidLoggingCommands: ["intercept", "myCustomCommand"]
```

To disable tracking of all cypress commands for specific code block you can use `logCommandSteps` api method:
```js
// disable tracking cypress commands:
cy.allure().logCommandSteps(false);
cy.login(username, password);
// enable tracking cypress commands back again:
cy.allure().logCommandSteps();
```

A lot of respect to [Sergey Korol](serhii.s.korol@gmail.com) who made [Allure-mocha](https://github.com/allure-framework/allure-js/tree/master/packages/allure-mocha) reporter. Base integration with Cypress internal mocha runner is based on that solution.
